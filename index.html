            My hobby is drawing. I love to draw with different colours. Drawing makes me happy. My favourite time is when I finish school because at that time I get free time to draw or paint.


            I love to draw anime character on my tablet. They are my favourite drawings. I share my drawings with all my friends and family and they love them. Here is a drawing I made of an anime character called Naruto:

        <p> My inspiration comes from youtube. I watch a lot of people making drawing and paintings etc. I saw some people make digital drawing of anime charecters and decided to try it myself. I took a picture from the internet, opened my drawing app, imported the picture in a new canvas and set the picture aside, and I started drawing the picture. It took a lot of attempts but after practice I got better at digital drawing. Here is a video I came across and helped me make my first digital drawing.
